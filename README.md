Hey, nice to meet you, you found this Jekyll theme. Here the yet another theme is a modern theme, and it's quiet clear, clean and neat for writers and posts.

## Installation

Add this line to your Jekyll site's `Gemfile`:

```ruby
gem "jekyll-theme-yat"
```

And add this line to your Jekyll site's `_config.yml`:

```yaml
theme: jekyll-theme-yat
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install jekyll-theme-yat

## Usage

Add or update your available layouts, includes, sass and/or assets.

GitHub Pages runs in `safe` mode and only allows [a set of whitelisted plugins](https://pages.github.com/versions/).
To use the third-party gem in GitHub Pages without limitation:

* Here is a GitHub Action named [jekyll-deploy-action](https://github.com/jeffreytse/jekyll-deploy-action) for Jekyll site deployment conveniently. üëç

## Development

To set up your environment to develop this theme, run `bundle install`.

Your theme is setup just like a normal Jekyll site! To test your theme, run `bundle exec jekyll serve` and open your browser at `http://localhost:4000`. This starts a Jekyll server using your theme. Add pages, documents, data, etc. like normal to test your theme's contents. As you make modifications to your theme and to your content, your site will regenerate and you should see the changes in the browser after a refresh, just like normal.

When your theme is released, only the files in `_data`, `_layouts`, `_includes`, `_sass` and `assets` tracked with Git will be bundled.
To add a custom directory to your theme-gem, please edit the regexp in `jekyll-theme-yat.gemspec` accordingly.
